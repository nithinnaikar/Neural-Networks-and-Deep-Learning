1. Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.
2. 1) We have access to a lot more data 2) We have access to a lot more computational power 3) Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in  important
applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
3. 1) Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea 2) Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers
to iterate more quickly 3) Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware)
4. False
5. Figure 3 represents the ReLU activation function. 
6. False
7. False
8. 1) It can be trained as a supervised learning problem 2) It is applicable when the input/output is 1D temporal sequence (e.g. sequence of words)
9. x-axis is the amount of data and y-axis is the performance of the algorithms
10. 1) Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithms performance, and it may help significantly (except in high bias cases) 2) Increasing the size
of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithms performance, and it may help significantly (except in high variance cases).
